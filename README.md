This project has been designed by students at Queen's University, Kingston as part of a year-and-a-half long capstone project. 
The goal of this project is to, using a capcitive sensor designed by Nundy and Professor Ameri, build a PCB with BLE capabilities which will communicate with an Android BLE app and display the sensor readings.
The sensor is to be placed on a user's elbow, allowing the strain applied while bending the elbow to be recorded. This project is designed with immobilized post-stroke patients and physiotherapeutic exercises in mind, with the goal of creating a market-ready product to aid patients in regaining full mobility.
